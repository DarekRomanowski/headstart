###CSS

Headstart's CSS is powered by SASS (SCSS), and utilizes a custom grid system based on [Suzy](http://susy.oddbird.net).

The setup works with a common.css file, which contains the site-wide (and repetitive) styles, accompanied by a page-specific css file (see the `page-template.scss` file) <del>which should be inserted through the back-end</del> **I am working on doing this automatically**.

The folder structure and base file setup is based on [BEM](http://bem.info/method/definitions/) and [SMACSS](http://smacss.com).
