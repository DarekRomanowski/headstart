# Miscellaneous

Headstart comes with some default files that should be around in any project.

+ `crossdomain.xml` — Prevent hotlinking by restricting access to your files from other domains.
+ `humans.txt` — Let the people know who built this thing.
+ `robits.txt` — Block certain robots from indexing your website.
+ `htaccess.txt` — Gets converted to a proper .htaccess file during the gulp process. Sets up some nice to haves.
