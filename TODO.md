### A list of things to explore:

  - Make sure regular css files can be used as well
  - Replace livereloading with browser-sync (https://github.com/shakyShane/browser-sync through http://shakyshane.com/gulpjs-sass-browsersync-ftw/)
  - Think about fixed size columns for eg ads
  - git tag the repo's (http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging)

### Workflow TODO's:

  - Fix image optimization (https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-imagemin)
  - Check if process still crashed with added/deleted folders
  - Scaffold boilerplate them from external repo
  - Allow custom repo's to be set for scaffolding
  - Add W3C validation option to config (https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-w3cjs/)
  - See if gulp-sass-graph can be replaced by gulp-newer (https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-changed/)
  - Find better (smaller, dep-less) way of stripping comments from --production HTML
  - Generate a cache manifeset for --production (https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-manifest/ + http://diveintohtml5.info/offline.html)
  - Fix logging by gulp-connect (Pull-req, fork & fix, or muting https://www.npmjs.org/package/mute-stream)
  - Make sure flags are inter-changeable (eg running --open without --server should throw error)
  - Fix sass and js watch to trigger on new/deleted files

### Website TODO's

  - Lazy load header image to improve initial load time (http://bttrlazyloading.julienrenaux.fr/demo/different-sizes.php OR https://github.com/shprink/bttrlazyloading/ OR something else :)
