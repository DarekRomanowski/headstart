### A list of things to explore:

  - Make sure regular css files can be used as well
  - Think about upgrading (eg. user settings that stay local, app files)-
  - Replace livereloading with browser-sync (https://github.com/shakyShane/browser-sync through http://shakyshane.com/gulpjs-sass-browsersync-ftw/)
  - Think about fixed size columns for eg ads
  - Look at Deporder again to improve script deps (https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-deporder/)
  - Implement W3C validator (https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-w3cjs/)
  - Implement app manifest generator (https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-manifest/ + http://diveintohtml5.info/offline.html)
  - git tag the repo's (http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging)

### Common TODO's:
