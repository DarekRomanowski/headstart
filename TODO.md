A list of things to explore:

  - Make sure regular css files can be used as well
  - Re-write docs
  - Think about upgrading (eg. user settings that stay local, app files)
  - Take a look at [fastclick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick)
  - Check if IE scripts and CSS can be fetched through JS rather then conditional comments (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5574842/best-way-to-check-for-ie-less-than-9-in-javascript-without-library + http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/script-loading/#toc-quick-reference (scroll up))
