## About

Headstart has grown from a basic boilerplate file into a no-brainer workflow that takes care of the tedious tasks that come with modern front-end development.
Although some practises might be considered opinionated (this is still a one-man show), Headstart does encourage the use of certain patterns and structures that will make you fast and organised.
